    "intro": "We hold citizenship, yet life's anxieties do not ask about borders, and war, climate, and inequality do not demand passports.\n\nToday's world is connected as one, yet justice remains fragmented; wealth moves freely, but human dignity stops at borders.\n\nWe declare a new political resolve in this age of contradiction.",

        "content": "War begins at borders, but suffering spreads across the world. Climate crisis is not a problem of any particular nation, yet its damage always concentrates on the poorest.\n\nMilitary spending expands, but peace has not been a subject of investment; under the name of national interest, citizens' lives have been reduced to calculations.\n\nToday's international order speaks of peace yet is maintained through war, speaks of human rights yet neglects inequality.\n\nFurther silence in this order is complicity."

        "title": "2. War Is the Result of Failed Politics",
        "content": "War is not an inevitable natural disaster. It is the result of politics that failed to negotiate, economics that failed to distribute, and an international order that abandoned dignity.\n\nAs long as we believe that increasing weapons strengthens security, peace will always be postponed to the next generation.\n\nThe Happy Society Party declares:\nTrue security comes not from the size of military power, but from conditions that make people not want war.\nPolitics that speaks of peace while neglecting poverty, discrimination, resource monopoly, and climate destruction is false."

        "title": "3. Global Inequality Is a Global Problem",
        "content": "Today's world is structured so that inequality between nations and inequality within nations reinforce each other.\n\nTransnational capital crosses borders, but labor and rights are tied to borders; platforms and AI integrate the world, but profits concentrate in the hands of a few.\n\nThis inequality is not one nation's policy failure but a global political failure.\nTherefore, solutions must not remain at the national level."

        "title": "5. Technology Connects Humanity, But Control Has Disappeared",
        "content": "AI and automation have spread beyond borders, but their control and responsibility remain vacant.\nThe more technology replaces labor, the more unstable citizens' lives have become, and international norms have not kept pace with technology's speed.\n\nThe Happy Society Party declares:\nTechnology should not be the exclusive property of nations or corporations but humanity's common asset.\nInternational democratic control over AI, data, and platforms and technology norms centered on labor and human rights are needed right now."

        "content": "The Happy Society Party is not a party representing any one nation's interests, but an international progressive party that unites based on citizens' dignity.\n\nWe pursue:\n• International politics that invests in peace, not war\n• A world economy based on cooperation, not competition\n• Development models that prioritize life's safety over growth\n• International norms that treat climate and technology as public responsibilities\n• Democracy where citizens unite beyond nationality\n\nHappiness cannot be confined within borders, and dignity cannot be divided by passports."

War and peace, climate crisis, technology control, inequality, and the retreat of democracy are problems that cannot be solved by any one nation's power alone.\n\nYet politics remains confined within borders, and citizens' suffering is pushed to the periphery of the international order.\n\nWe declare the common foundation of a new progressive politics where citizens of each country become the protagonists, each country's party decides autonomously, and solidarity is global.\n\nThis platform is not a document for creating one central party, but common values and principles of action that local parties in each country can share."
